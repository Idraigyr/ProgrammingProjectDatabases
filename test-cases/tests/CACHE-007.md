# Asset Caching Test Cases

## Test Case 7: Asset Caching on First Loading Test

- **Test Case ID:** CACHE-007
- **Test Case Description:** Verify that when a player logs in for the first time, certain 3D models and images are stored in the cache using IndexedDB, improving asset loading speed for subsequent game sessions.
- **Preconditions:** 
  - The game is accessible and functional.
  - The player is logging in for the first time on the device or cleared the cache.
- **Test Steps:** 
  1. First Time Login:
     - Log in to the game with a new player account.
  2. Monitor Cache Population:
     - Verify that certain 3D models and images are being stored in the cache using IndexedDB.
     - Check the cache size and confirm that it increases after the first login.
  3. Verify Asset Loading Speed:
     - Log out of the game and close the application.
     - Log in again with the same player account.
     - Observe the loading speed of assets such as 3D models and images.
     - Compare the loading speed with and without cached assets.
- **Expected Results:** 
  - When a player logs in for the first time, certain 3D models and images should be stored in the cache using IndexedDB.
  - The cache size should increase after the first login.
  - Subsequent logins should demonstrate improved asset loading speed due to cached assets.
- **Postconditions:** 
  - The player should experience faster asset loading times in subsequent game sessions after the first login.
- **Notes:** 
  - Verify that the correct 3D models and images are being cached and retrieved from IndexedDB.
  - Test the functionality with different types and sizes of assets to ensure effective caching.
  - Ensure that the caching process does not significantly impact the overall performance or stability of the game.
